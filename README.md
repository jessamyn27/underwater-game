Underwater Game!

Merbaby needs to avoid the hook and collect the shells!

If she collects all the shells she wins!
If she gets hooked, she dies and tries again...

slow start, intention is to add in points and a reset after either all shells are collected or hook gets Her

spent a lot of time learning canvas and animation in general, in retrospect would have done a non animated game using jQuery and vanilla javascript and just worked on my structure and functions, getting better at DRY code and event listeners...
